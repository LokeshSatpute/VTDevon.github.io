        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
        <!-- Modify per page -->
        <p>
          The design of EventSphere aims to deliver a comprehensive, modular, and scalable event management platform that meets the diverse needs of organizers, attendees, and vendors. This system integrates various services such as ticketing, payment processing, order management, real-time vendor coordination, and analytics into a seamless experience. EventSphere leverages event-driven architecture to maintain responsiveness during high-demand scenarios, ensuring smooth operations across multiple services.
          The platform is structured to support high availability, secure transactions, and real-time updates, essential for large-scale events with fluctuating traffic and operational demands. By adopting a layered architecture and domain-driven design (DDD), the system ensures that each function, from ticket generation to post-event reporting, operates independently but cohesively. These design decisions promote maintainability and flexibility, allowing for easy enhancements and future scalability.
          This design rationale outlines the key functions of EventSphere, explains the design decisions made for each function, and provides a justification for how these decisions align with the systemâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements. From managing ticket lifecycles with QR codes to enabling real-time vendor management and providing actionable analytics, the system is built to offer a robust and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.
