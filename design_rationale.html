        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
        <!-- Modify per page -->
        <p>
          The design of EventSphere aims to deliver a comprehensive, modular, and scalable event management platform that meets the diverse needs of organizers, attendees, and vendors. This system integrates various services such as ticketing, payment processing, order management, real-time vendor coordination, and analytics into a seamless experience. EventSphere leverages event-driven architecture to maintain responsiveness during high-demand scenarios, ensuring smooth operations across multiple services.
          The platform is structured to support high availability, secure transactions, and real-time updates, essential for large-scale events with fluctuating traffic and operational demands. By adopting a layered architecture and domain-driven design (DDD), the system ensures that each function, from ticket generation to post-event reporting, operates independently but cohesively. These design decisions promote maintainability and flexibility, allowing for easy enhancements and future scalability.
          This design rationale outlines the key functions of EventSphere, explains the design decisions made for each function, and provides a justification for how these decisions align with the systemâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements. From managing ticket lifecycles with QR codes to enabling real-time vendor management and providing actionable analytics, the system is built to offer a robust and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.

        <h3> Function 1: Ticket Management and QR Code Generation</h3>
        <h4> The Ticketing Module (DE-3) manages the entire lifecycle of tickets by employing the State Machine pattern to transition tickets between states such as "Available," "Reserved," "Sold," and "Checked-In." Upon successful ticket purchase, the system generates a unique QR code (DE-6) that consolidates ticket and merchandise information. If attendees make additional purchases or cancel their orders, the QR code is updated dynamically to reflect these changes in real time, ensuring accuracy and consistency (FR-6, FR-11). At the event entrance, the QR code enables quick check-ins, simplifying attendee entry and minimizing delays (FR-7).

          The State Machine pattern (DE-3) ensures that the system tracks each ticket's state accurately throughout its lifecycle. Meanwhile, the QR Code Module (DE-6) streamlines operations by embedding all relevant order information into a single code, reducing the need for multiple documents and enhancing the attendee experience.</h4>
